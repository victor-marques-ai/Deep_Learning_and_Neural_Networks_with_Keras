### Project Repository ([IBM Course](https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-data-and-cybersecurity-p47a2/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)) 

This repository brings the fundamentals of deep learning and practical implementation with the Keras library, through theoretical insights and hands-on labs.

Through this course, I deepened my understanding of key deep learning concepts, including forward and backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions. I also explored practical solutions for training deep networks, tackling issues like vanishing gradients by experimenting with different architectures and activation functions.

> **Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras**

✅ Understand core concepts of neural networks, including:
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent
- Activation functions
  
✅ Train deep networks and handle challenges like vanishing gradients  

✅ Implement deep learning solutions for regression and classification tasks

✅ Explore advanced architectures:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Transformers
  - Autoencoders
    
✅ Use pretrained models for transfer learning  

✅ Complete a capstone project on image classification and captioning
